[2026-02-14] Completed CLI Channel Management Implementation (Tasks 1.1 - 6.1)
- Verified database and database-models dependencies were already in CLI Cargo.toml
- Verified channel.rs module with all required functions (parse_channel_type, get_default_models, get_default_base_url, cmd_channel_add, cmd_channel_list, cmd_channel_delete, cmd_channel_show, handle_channel_command)
- Updated commands.rs with channel subcommand definitions (add, list, delete, show)
- Added channel command handling logic with database connection management
- Verified lib.rs already exports channel module
- All unit tests pass (3 tests for parse_channel_type, get_default_models, get_default_base_url)
- Full project build passes without errors
- Remaining: Integration tests (Tasks 6.2 - 6.12) require runtime execution
